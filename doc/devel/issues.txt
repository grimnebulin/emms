** emms-info-native does not write playing time to track
Calculating the duration of a track is not trivial. See here:
https://shadowfacts.net/2021/mp3-duration/

An native implementation of track duration would be welcome:

** exiftool info writes "0" playing time to track


** exiftool info writes garbage to info-note ("Comment") field


** Fran's mpris branch
Follow up with Fran on the mpris branch with the goal of merging it.


** recreate: Scrobbing to libre.fm silently failing
Scrobbing to libre.fm is reported to silently fail despite a
successful handshake. This has not been recreated yet.


** test and improve the quickstart section of the manual


** automatic player discovery and configuration
Ideally, players would be discovered and a file with the configuration
would be written to the ".emacs.d/emms/" directory.


** automatic info method discovery and configuration
info methods would be discovered and a file with the configuration
would be written to the ".emacs.d/emms/" directory.


** option to make the space key play and pause in browser


** Emms-player-mpd: doesn't see if other clients pause the daemon
*** From: Bj√∂rn Bidar via <emms-help@gnu.org>, 13 Nov 2022
"Hey, I noticed that when other mpd clients pause mpd Emms doesn't
notice it which results in `emms-playing-time-display-mode`/the
playing time continue to go on even thou the player is paused."
