** emms-info-native does not write playing time to track
Calculating the duration of a track is not trivial. See here:
https://shadowfacts.net/2021/mp3-duration/

An native implementation of track duration would be welcome:

** Fran's mpris branch
Follow up with Fran on the mpris branch with the goal of merging it.


** recreate: Scrobbing to libre.fm silently failing
Scrobbing to libre.fm is reported to silently fail despite a
successful handshake. This has not been recreated yet.


** test and improve the quickstart section of the manual
This is in process as of 09/12/2022.


** better "out of the box" experience with Emms
Try to achieve a situation where you invoke "M-x emms-setup" and after
being asked a few questions a configuration is written for the user.

Ideally, players would be discovered and a file with the configuration
would be written to the ".emacs.d/emms/" directory, the same can be
done for info methods.

Finally, the user can be asked for their music directory, and Emms can
do the "add-directory-tree" for them.


** option to make the space key play and pause in browser


** Emms-player-mpd: doesn't see if other clients pause the daemon
*** From: Bj√∂rn Bidar via <emms-help@gnu.org>, 13 Nov 2022
"Hey, I noticed that when other mpd clients pause mpd Emms doesn't
notice it which results in `emms-playing-time-display-mode`/the
playing time continue to go on even thou the player is paused."
